## Machine Learning Technical Skills

### Machine Learning Implementations in C++:
Data Exploration in C++: Implemented functions in C++ to open and import a .csv data file, read in the data, split the data into rm and medv sets, and calculate their sum, mean, median, range. Finally, calculated the correlation and covariance between the datasets.

C++ Algorithms from Scratch: Implemented Machine Learning algorithms to calculate logistic regressions, predictions, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in C++. Also implemented Naive Bayes models to do the same.
### Machine Learning in R:

Linear Models in R: Imported, cleaned, and explored data in R. Implemented graphs and residual plots to visualize data. Finally, implemented three different linear regression algorithms in R, and compared predications and correlations.

K-means Clustering in R: Implemented k-means clustering to visualize groupings within data. Implemented many types of clustering, such as hierarchical clustering and model based clustering.
### Machine Learning in Python:
Python Machine Learning using sklearn: Implemented data cleanup, graphing, logistic regression, classification, decision tree, and multiple neural networks to compare results.

Keras Image Classification: Implemented types of classification models such as the basic sequential model, as well as a pretrained model in Python using keras.
## Soft Skills

### Teamwork Skills: Worked with a teammate on the Linear Models, C++ Algorithms, and Image Classification projects:
Gained experience in project management, communication, scheduling, and being flexible to work with the team.

### Independent Project Skills: Worked independently on Data Exploration, Clustering, and ML with sklearn projects:
Gained experience in time management, research, and analytical skills.
