# Summary
Going into this class, I didn't have any experience with Machine Learning, and all of the concepts it entailed. This class taught me not only the skills necessary to learn Machine Learning, but also opened me up to the field at large, and the directions the industry is trending towards. I learnt many principal skills for Machine Learning such as data cleanup, performing mathematical calculations, and visualizing data using graphs. I also learnt to implement linear regression models, logistic regression models, classification models, clustering models, and naive bayes models. Finally, I learnt how to use libraries such as sklearn and keras to implement neural network models, as well as image classification models.

Following this class, I am much more enthusiastic about the machine learning industry as a whole. This class, coupled with the rapid progress of AI and ML models that are making headlines today, has implored me to keep up with industry trends. My immediate plans for future ML projects involve learning PyTorch, which is quckly becoming the industry standard for ML implementations. My aim is to gain certifications, so that I can potentially look into employment in the ML or the big data industry.
